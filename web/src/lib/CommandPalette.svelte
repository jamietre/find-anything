<!-- TODO: post-MVP — Ctrl+P command palette for fuzzy file search -->
<!--
	When implemented, this component will:
	- Open on Ctrl+P
	- Fetch full file lists from GET /api/v1/files?source=X for each active source
	- Filter client-side by substring/score as the user types
	- Support arrow-key navigation and Enter to open in FileViewer
-->
